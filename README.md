## Description
My motivation was to build a robust and scalable back end using the latest technologies, such as Express.js API and Sequelize ORM, to enable an e-commerce company to compete with other businesses in the industry. I built this project to create a reliable and high-performing back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js API and Sequelize ORM to efficiently manage and retrieve data from a MySQL database. The back end I built using Express.js API and Sequelize ORM for an e-commerce site solves the problem of managing large amounts of data and enabling seamless integration with a MySQL database to support efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Throughout the process of building the back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js API and Sequelize ORM, I learned how to efficiently manage and manipulate data using a MySQL database and gained a deeper understanding of how to create scalable and robust back end solutions.

## Installation
1. Go to this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jason1chiu/E-Commerce-Backend)
2. Git clone this repo using HTTPS or SSH into a folder of your choice
3. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
4. Install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/)
5. Enter "npm i" in the command-line applciation to install the necessary node modules
6. Install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com)


## Usage
To begin using the E-commerce Platform, it is necessary to create a ".env" file containing the MySQL database connection environment variables, such as database name, your username, and your password in the same directory where the project was cloned. In the application's "./db" folder, there is a SQL file that can be utilized to create the ecommerce_db database, which can be accessed through MySQL by entering "mysql -u root -p" on the terminal and then the password. After accessing the interface, enter "source ./db/schema.sql" to establish the default database. Once the process is complete, exit MySQL, and use Node.js to execute the application by running "npm run seed" to establish the default data stored in the "./seeds" folder, followed by "node server" or "npm start". Finally, it is possible to use tools such as Insomnia or Postman to test the API endpoints and ensure that they are able to create, read, update, and delete data from the MySQL database. A video in the [Test](#test) section will give you a demonstration.
